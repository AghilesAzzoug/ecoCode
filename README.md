## How green is your app?

These days, more and more people as well as companies want to act to take care of our planet. We want to be more responsible in the way we build and use our digital world, we need to !

[ecoCode](https://github.com/cnumr/ecoCode) is a set of good and bad practices ("smells") for application development.

## Projects

We created (for now !) [4 different SonarQube plugins](sonarqube-plugin-greenit/) :
- [Java](sonarqube-plugin-greenit/native-analyzer/java-plugin/)
- [PHP](sonarqube-plugin-greenit/native-analyzer/php-plugin/)
- [Python](sonarqube-plugin-greenit/native-analyzer/python-plugin/)
- [Android](sonarqube-plugin-greenit/native-analyzer/android-plugin/)

All of these use smells described here :

- [good_practices](good_practices/) for web : Java, PHP and Python.
- [A set of smells](https://olegoaer.perso.univ-pau.fr/android-energy-smells/) theorised by Olivier Le Goaër for Android

## Install

You can download each plugin separatly or you can directly use a [all-in-one docker-compose](sonarqube-plugin-greenit/INSTALL.md)
