ecoCode is a collective project aiming the reduction the environmental footprint of IT at the software level. The goal of the project is to provide a curated list of lint-like tools to remove quality flaws in your codebase that should have an ecological impact: energy consumption, fatware, lifespan of terminals, etc.

ecoCode relies on evolving catalogs of [good practices](good_practices/), for various technologies. SonarQube plugins then implement these catalogs as rules.

**Warning**: this is still a very early stage project. Any feedback or contribution will be highly appreciated. Please refer to the contribution section.
